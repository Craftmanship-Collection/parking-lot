# Parking Lot

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of a Parking Lot in Java, designed to help with Low-Level Design (LLD) preparation and interviews. Each branch represents a different team member's solution to the parking lot problem.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three branches, each containing a different implementation of the parking lot:

* ```parkinglot/lynx```
* ```parkinglot/pavan```
* ```parkinglot/manoj```
* ```parkinglot/manik```

## Purpose

This repository serves as a learning resource for:

1. Understanding different approaches to logging framework design
2. Practicing Low-Level Design (LLD) concepts
3. Preparing for technical interviews focusing on system design
4. Comparing different implementations of the same problem

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Java JDK 11 or higher
* Maven or Gradle (based on the implementation)

### Running the Examples

* Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Craftmanship-Collection/parking-lot/
cd parking-lot
```

* Switch to a specific member's solution branch

```bash
git checkout <<member-branch>>
```

Follow the specific instructions in each branch's README for building and running that particular solution
